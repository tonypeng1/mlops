This is the product of a fantastic open-source course on end-to-end
machine learning by Goku Mohandas. Name of the site is "Made With ML" ([site_url](https://madewithml.com/)) and the code repository
is at [repo_url](https://github.com/GokuMohandas/mlops-course/).

This streamlit site is based
on my own repository ([site_url](https://github.com/tonypeng1/mlops)). The modification includes:

1. Added docstrings to explain the workflow ([mkdocs_url](https://tonypeng1.github.io/mlops/)),
2. DVC (data version control) data extraction from a Google service account.

This project aims to demonstrate an end-to-end MLOps process using a language model that
categorizes an ML paper to either computer vision, mlops, natural language processing, or others.

## MLOps Lessons
